## Usage Notes

1. **All metrics in this simulator are derived from published, peer-reviewed sources**
2. **Data represents industry averages** - individual company/asset performance varies
3. **Cost estimates are simplified proxies** - actual R&D costs depend on indication, geography, trial design
4. **Success rates have been declining** - 2014-2023 data shows lower rates than earlier periods
